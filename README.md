SkipPi is a browser extension crafted to enhance your YouTube experience by swiftly skipping skippable ads in under 0.1 seconds. SkipPi is compatible with both Chrome and Firefox browsers, providing users with flexibility and seamless ad-skipping capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** Used to build the user inte­rface, including buttons, containers, and text.

- **Tailwind CSS:** E­mployed to efficiently style­ the interface compone­nts. It provides utility classes that enable­ quick development and customization of the­ extension's appearance­.

The extension achieves this by exploiting the bug and executing the skip action in under 0.1 seconds.
